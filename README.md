# Canvas5
## An easy-to-use JavaScript API for the HTML5 Canvas.

### About Canvas5

  Canvas5 can be used to minimize literally hundreds of lines of code into just a few lines. It was completely written by me, Sergix. It was originally intended for my own use as an HTML5 Canvas game developer but it is available now as open-source code. The current buildof Canvas5 includes the basic functions to create and set up a game. It can be used as either an interface in its entirety or simply as a tool to create and store sprites or other objects. Feel free to create code that is compatible with Canvas5 such as "plugins" or other  add-ons, or for incorporating Canvas5's objects into your own scripts.  

### Installing Canvas5

  To install and use Canvas5 in your projects, clone the Git Repository at `https://github.com/Sergix7440/Canvas5`. There are multiple versions of Canvas5 in this folder. Release, or stable, versions are in the `build/release` folder. Development versions are in the `build/dev` folder.  

  __Development (dev) versions may be very error-prone, as they have not been tested for the release!__ But if you _do_ find errors, please feel free to open a Pull Request and post the issue to be resolved. Any help is greatly appreciated!  
  
  One you have found the file of your selected version, copy the file into your projects directory, preferably the same one as your project's JavaScript file. In your HTML, add `<script src="canvas5-version.js"></script>`. After this, you can begin coding!

### Documentation

  Documentation can be found in the _docs_ folder in the Canvas5 Repository. New documentation is published with every new release version.
