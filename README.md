## Canvas5
Canvas5 is an easy-to-use JavaScript API for the HTML5 Canvas.

  Canvas5 can be used to minimize literally hundreds of lines of code into just a few lines. It was completely written by me, Sergix. It was originally intended for my own use as an HTML5 Canvas game developer but it is available now as open-source code. The current buildof Canvas5 includes the basic functions to create and set up a game. It can be used as either an interface in its entirety or simply as a tool to create and store sprites or other objects. Feel free to create code that is compatible with Canvas5 such as "plugins" or other  add-ons, or for incorporating Canvas5's objects into your own scripts.
